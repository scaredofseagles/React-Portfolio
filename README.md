# React-Portfolio

## Description

A personal website with a portfolio of projects with social media links and an about me with React. This website also uses a responsive design to enable rendering on a variety of screen sizes and mobile devices.

## Technologies

* React.js
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 4
* FontAwesome
* JavaScript

## Goal of the Project

**Create a Responsive Portfolio web application**

In order to ensure the web application is responsive, I used Bootstrap's components and grid layout so that the contents are intact in a variety of screen sizes. To do this, I needed to use relational ratio for positions and widths and heights. In addition, I needed a navigation bar and a footer that was consistent through all pages and would be responsive.

As a portfolio, I needed an "About Me" page with a bio, and image of myself, with links to social media. I have also included a "Portfolio page" with links to past projects, and a "Contact" page with a contact form.

## Usage
The following image is an example of the web application's appearance and functionality:
